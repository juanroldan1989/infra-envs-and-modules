Experiment needs more details and to be refined

Current issue:

- Targets shown as "Unhealthy" for Internal Load Balancer
- Same targets are shown as "Healthy" for External Load Balancer

### Response to similar issue

Solution to EC2 instances (inside private subnets) being unhealthy:

```
The web server might not be installed in the EC2 instance. This may be because EC2 machines are launched in the private subnet and donâ€™t have internet access. So when we try to install the web server by putting the installation command in the EC2 user data section it fails.

Resolution: To resolve this create a NAT gateway in the public subnet and modify the routing table of the private subnet to point to the NAT gateway. This is the only step where a NAT gateway is required. It can be removed once the HTTP server is installed on EC2 instances.
```

## Load Balancer - Target Types

`Instance` vs. `IP`
